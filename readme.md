So I'm alittle late on the RequireJS/ Asynchronous Module Definition(AMD) bandwagon but it's not too late. hopefully I can get 10 projects done. I'll usually move away and attach it to projects as usual but at this moment it's something I'm getting used to using!

###[Calculator](#)

Making a simple calculator. Unless i'm feeling alittle more hyped up to make it more complicated and cool. It's the best way to start off with the now mysterious require js to me. Of course I will look back at this and laugh. Will make use of:

* RequireJS
* Jquery
* R.JS


[WIP]

More to come...
